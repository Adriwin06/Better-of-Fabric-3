# Better of Fabric 3

*A Vanilla-Plus Exploration & Adventure Modpack*

Originally made to play with some friends, I turned it into a fully-fledged modpack because I thought other players might enjoy it too.

**This Modpack** is a **Vanilla+ Exploration** and **Adventure** Modpack that will make you **rediscover Minecraft** without losing its Vanilla feel. Create a world, discover new biomes, fight bosses, make a farm, explore new dimensions, level up your equipment, find artifacts, build a beautiful house, craft insane new items... Everything that is in Minecraft, but **Enhanced**.

# ![Performance](https://i.imgur.com/9OW1B8c.png)

The modpack performs really well, even on low-end hardware, especially when playing on a server. Singleplayer also runs well, even though it is your PC that generates the chunks instead of an external server.

## Requirements

### Client-side
**Minimum allocated RAM:** 10 GB  
**Recommended allocated RAM:** 12 GB

### Server-side
**Minimum allocated RAM:** 6 GB  
**Recommended allocated RAM:** 8 GB

# ![FAQ](https://i.imgur.com/Qh1w6k3.png)

Here are the questions that are most likely to be asked.

### I don't like the immersive first person; how do I disable it?
You can simply press **F6** to toggle between the original and the new one.

### Why isn't there x mod?
This modpack focuses on performance and stability over mod count, so if a mod isn't there, it's probably because of that. But feel free to suggest mods in the comments.

#### Distant Horizon
It slows down chunk generation. The pack already runs well with **32 chunks of render distance**, so this one's optional.

#### Effective
Great mod, I wanted to include it, but the combination with other mods causes crashes. It's not the mod's fault, just the combination with other mods. It was replaced with Particular here.

## Setting up your server
Depending on which hosting service you use, it might be slightly different. They usually have a tutorial on how to install a modpack. Most of them have an installer that lets you choose the modpack, and everything gets installed automatically. You will still need to configure voice chat if you plan to use it: To **Configure Voice Chat** correctly on BisectHosting server, here is a really quick guide they made: [Voice Chat Setup on BisectHosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/198/How-to-setup-voice-chat-on-a-ForgeorFabricorSpigot-Minecraft-server.html)

If you want **faster chunk loading**, I recommend using **Chunky** to pre-generate chunks. You can set a high radius and let it run overnight. Pre-generated chunks load almost instantly.
