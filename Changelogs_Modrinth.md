## V1.1
Changelog after the v1.0 that never got approved neither on CurseForge or Modrinth.

---

### Adjustments
* Disabled shaders by default

---

### Content change
**Additions**
* Added **JourneyMap Waypoint Syncing**
* Added **Stoneholm**

**Substractions**
* Removed **Underground Villages**
* Removed **Blast** (The modpack needs to be the same as the one on CurseForge, but it got rejected because of the licensing of this mod, so I need to remove it on Modrinth too for consistency and compatibility with the server pack)

---

**Update**
* *Shaders*
  * Updated MakeUp - Ultra Fast
* *Mods*
  * Updated Crash Assistant
  * Updated OptiGUI
  * Updated Bookshelf

---

**Requiered changes**

These are the changes that are required for the pack to be approved here on Modrinth. Since I will keep the mods on the CurseForge version, it means that the version won't be exactly the same now, but both should be compatible with a server that runs this modpack.
