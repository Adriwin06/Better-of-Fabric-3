# Better of Fabric 3

*A Vanilla-Plus Exploration & Adventure Modpack*

Originally made to play with some friends, I turned it into a fully-fledged modpack because I thought other players might enjoy it too.

**This Modpack** is a **Vanilla+ Exploration** and **Adventure** Modpack that will make you **rediscover Minecraft** without losing its Vanilla feel. Create a world, discover new biomes, fight bosses, make a farm, explore new dimensions, level up your equipment, find artifacts, build a beautiful house, craft insane new items... Everything that is in Minecraft, but **Enhanced**.

With **stunning shaders**, **vivid new biomes**, and **thousands of new blocks and structures**, this modpack turns Minecraft into a true **visual masterpiece**. Still not convinced? Head to the screenshots tab and see the beauty for yourself!

# ![Performance](https://i.imgur.com/9OW1B8c.png)

The modpack performs really well, even on low-end hardware, especially when playing on a server. Singleplayer also runs well, even though it is your PC that generates the chunks instead of an external server.

## Requirements

### Client-side
**Minimum allocated RAM:** 10 GB  
**Recommended allocated RAM:** 12 GB

### Server-side
**Minimum allocated RAM:** 6 GB  
**Recommended allocated RAM:** 8 GB

## Shaders
By default, shaders are **disabled**, but you can enable them at any time: **the game looks absolutely stunning with shaders on**. You'll notice more vibrant, colorful lighting and an overall enhanced atmosphere.

I've already configured the shaders with better settings than the defaults, so you get a great experience right away. However, these improved settings can also reduce performance a bit more than the default.

If your PC struggles with a particular shader pack, **open its settings and lower the graphics preset** (almost all shaders have this option). Just keep in mind that changing presets may overwrite some of my custom settings, but it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal; just some cool effects might get disabled.

The screenshots you see in the gallery tab were taken using Complementary+Euphoria. The game looks incredible with this shader, and I **really recommend** that you play with it for the best possible experience.

# ![FAQ](https://i.imgur.com/Qh1w6k3.png)

Here are the questions that are most likely to be asked.

### I don't like the immersive first person; how do I disable it?
You can simply press **F6** to toggle between the original and the new one.

### Why isn't there x mod?
This modpack focuses on performance and stability over mod count, so if a mod isn't there, it's probably because of that. But feel free to suggest mods in the comments.

#### Distant Horizon
It slows down chunk generation. The pack already runs well with **32 chunks of render distance**, so this one's optional.

#### Effective
Great mod, I wanted to include it, but the combination with other mods causes crashes. It's not the mod's fault, just the combination with other mods. It was replaced with Particular here.

# ![Server Configuration](https://i.imgur.com/yuHWmbd.png)

## Setting up your server
Depending on which hosting service you use, it might be slightly different. They usually have a tutorial on how to install a modpack. Most of them have an installer that lets you choose the modpack, and everything gets installed automatically. You will still need to configure voice chat if you plan to use it: To **Configure Voice Chat** correctly on BisectHosting server, here is a really quick guide they made: [Voice Chat Setup on BisectHosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/198/How-to-setup-voice-chat-on-a-ForgeorFabricorSpigot-Minecraft-server.html)

To manually download the server pack, search for the version of the modpack you are using on [this page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-of-fabric-3/files), click on it and download the server pack zip file.

If you want **faster chunk loading**, I recommend using **Chunky** to pre-generate chunks. You can set a high radius and let it run overnight. Pre-generated chunks load almost instantly.

The modpack is available on both [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-of-fabric-3) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/better-of-fabric-3), so choose the one you prefer. The only thing that is only on CurseForge is the server pack, since we can't upload files larger than 500mb on Modrinth.
